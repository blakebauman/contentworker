/**
 * A pending agent proposal awaiting a human decision — the persisted half of
 * the human-in-the-loop gate. A workflow that ends `needs_review` creates one
 * of these carrying the proposed field values; a reviewer approves (the values
 * are applied as a new draft version) or rejects it. On durable runtimes a
 * detached review-watcher workflow waits for the decision as a signal/event;
 * everywhere else the decision use-case applies directly. `awaiting` records
 * whether a watcher is armed; `appliedAt` is the exactly-once apply marker
 * (whichever path wins the CAS applies, the other skips).
